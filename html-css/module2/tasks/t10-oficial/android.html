                Android Mascot Story
            </h1>
            <p>
                You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system maintained by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But maybe you don't know that your cute pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The first version
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectoring images) and created his own robot version. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2>
                A new mascot appears
            </h2>
            <p>
                The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.
            </p>

            </picture>
            <p>
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with whoever is looking at it. Then came <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot.
            </p>

            </picture>
            <p>
                The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in Google's office and looked to the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                    Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - <abbr title="Co-op with KitKat">KitKat</abbr></li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
