            <h1 class="title" id="main-title">Android Mascot Story</h1>
            <p>
                You probably know that the Android operating system maintained by Google is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But maybe you don't know that your cute pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">The first version</h2>
            <p>
                The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named Dan Morrill. He says that he opened Inkscape (free software for image vectorization) and created his own robot version. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.
            </p>

            <p>
                This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: it would be the Dandroids.

            <h2 class="title">A new mascot appears</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator Irina Blok, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.

                <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina-blok">
            <p>
                Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with whoever is looking at it. Then came Bugdroid, the new Android mascot.
            </p>
                <img src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid">
            <p>
                The main inspiration for the features of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in Google's office and looked to the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                    Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.5 - Cupcake <br>
                    1.6 - Donut <br>
                    3.0 - Eclair <br>

                    2.3 - Gingerbread <br>

                    7.0 - Nougat <br>
                    8.0 - Oreo <br>
                    9.0 - Pie <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
